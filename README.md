# Music-Recommendation-Using-FP-Growth-algortihm
In this Project, the association rule data mining (ARM) technique was employed using the Frequent Pattern Growth mining algorithm (FP-Growth) to learn the music listening behavior of listeners in different communities, identify associations among music playlist and recommend new music to users

DATASET DESCRIPTION

The data set is an open dataset from lastfm. Lastfm is a music listening streaming platform. The data was created and published by the same owners. The domain of the dataset is related to music. The data is available in a comma separated value (CSV) format and it has a shape of 289955 rows and 4 columns.

METHODOLOGY
The methodology for this project involved application of techniques in big data analytics lifecycle.  The techniques explored are 
1. Data-preprocessing, 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data visualization
4. Association rule mining (ARM)

The methodology is implemented programmatically on with pyspark i.e python API for Apache Spark framework. pyspark is employed for data exploration actions and transformations because it is well suited to handle big data mining tasks due to its flexible, scalable, and fast execution
